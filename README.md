# SPAC-SupplementaryMaterials
Supplementary material repository for Robust Video Content Alignment and Compensation framework for rain removal applications.

1. Under the videoDemo folder are the rain removal video clips used for evaluations in the paper:

   The 8 video files starting with "synthetic_" are the derain results for the synthetic rain dataset used for quantitative evaluations in our paper.
      - The 4 videos with names "Synthetic_slow_axxx.mp4" belongs to group a.
      - The 4 videos with names "Synthetic_fast_bxxx.mp4" belongs to group b.
      
   The 7 video files starting with "realrain_" are derain results for real rain.
      
2. Under the SupperPixel_Matching_Evaluations foder are the results of SP units vs. rectangular patches for the Middleburry Stereo Dataset. Matching results for the SP units are with names "xxx_sp.png", and the results for the rectangular patches are with names "xxx_blk.png".
